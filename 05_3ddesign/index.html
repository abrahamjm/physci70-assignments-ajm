  <h3>Week 5: 3D Design and Printing</h3>
    
      <p> I've struggled to find rings that fit me, so I decided to fabricate a few rings with inlayed text printed for my hands.</p>

      <p> After measuring my hand and creating the basic smooth shape of the ring, my challenge was to inlay the text at an even depth across the curved surface. I created a tangent plane to put the flat text on, then extruded it to the surface of the ring. <p>

      <p>Prints for the rings were rapid even with a 20% infill. Each took roughly 12 minutes on the Prusa. My second ring is a copy of an old ring of my fathers. Instead of scanning it, I measured and did my best to match the font and text placement.</p>

       <p> By reducing the depth of engraving, I was able to make the printed text slightly sharper. However, the letters still appear slightly distorted.

      <p> 3D printing the rings alowed me to carefully fillet the edges, which would have been challenging using the laser cutter. I can imagine, however, that a CNC machine could do a better job accurately creating the text subtractively, since the warm material has a tendency to sag into the empty space. </p>

      <p> In order to create a small stand for the rings, I used the Sense scanner to create a scan of my hand. After exporting as a obj file and importing into the Prusa slicer, I was able to scale it down. It is printing now!</p>
