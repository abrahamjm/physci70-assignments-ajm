  <h3>Week 1: Introduction & Documentation</h3>
    <div class="row">
    
      <p> Before Thursday, I'd never made a breadboard or worked with circuits. It was exciting to assemble the simple circuit and experiment with the multimeter. </p>

      <p> After sucessfully lighting the led, I wondered if the resistor was directional. In order to test this, I measured the voltage across the resistor twice, once with it in both orientations. <p>

      <img src="../01_intro/resistorB.png" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="resistorB">
      <p> As is shown in the above photos, the voltage across the resistor is almost exactly the same regardless of orientation, suggesting that the resistor is not directional. </p>
      <p> After connecting the circuit to the 5V USB output which fed the resistor/LED unattenuated current directly from the battery, the led was substantially brighter, though I failed to photograph it. </p>
      <p> While I attemped to run the Blink program, I struggled to give the Arduino permission to access the port on my laptop. However, I had just updated to the new Mac OS and had been suffering from a series of permissions errors which I have now resolved. I'm curious to see if I can sucessfully get my computer and the Arduino running now! </p>
