   <p> I’m a massive Shakespeare nerd and musician. While I began playing classical violin, I got my chops playing fiddle for English folk dance. Now I play, record, and perform on multiple instruments in DC and Boston. Here I study English and TDM.

  On stage as a musician and actor, I'm fascinated by audience contact and response. Early Modern theaters were lit universally. Actors could see the audience and audience members could see each other. Is it possible to capture that connection in film?

  As a properties designer, I’ve built large  props including most recently a magical carriage made of interwoven branches. I love the magic of props, and am excited to think about how the fabrication techniques of the course could be used to create magic on stage in the smallest design element of theater.
